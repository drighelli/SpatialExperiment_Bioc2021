Description: Cells spatial organization within tissues is important for the 
    understanding of cell communications and interactions in developmental, 
    physiological, and pathological states.
    Lately several technologies are emerging for the joint extraction of
    transcripts quantification and their spatial organization at single cell level.
    Among others, seqFISH and 10x Visium Spatial Gene Expression (VSGE) seem to be 
    the most widely used platforms because of their ability to extract hundreds to 
    thousands of transcripts at the same time in the first case and for the standard 
    protocol implemented in the latter.
    Briefly, seqFISH combines temporal barcodes in multiple hybridization rounds 
    with microscopy fluorescent imaging to detect the spatial coordinates of
    transcripts.
    On the other hand, VSGE allows the joint analysis of microscopy images of a
    chip-placed frozen piece of tissue and its transcriptome at spot-barcode level.
    Given the lack of dedicated general tools for spatial transcriptomics, 
    we developed the SpatialExperiment Bioconductor package, which presents a
    set of two dedicated classes (SpatialExperiment and VisiumExperiment) both 
    extending the SingleCellExperiment Bioconductor class with slots and methods 
    for spatial transcriptomics data handling.
    This work could become the basis for facilitating further development of
    methods aimed to analyze this type of data, e.g., for spatial clustering 
    and the identification of spatially variable genes.
    Here, we present a short workshop showing how to analyze spatial transcriptomics
    with our SpatialExperiment package and how to use it in combination with other 
    analysis software.
    We will start by showing how to combine a SpatialExperiment with a 
    SingleCellExperiment to store multimodal datasets such as seqFISH 
    and scRNAseq and how to manage them to graphically visualize the data.
    Additionally, we will show how to create a VisiumExperiment object 
    starting from 10x Genomics public datasets and how to manage it for 
    clustering annotation and plotting.
