Description: Spatially resolved transcriptomics is a new set of technologies to 
    measure gene expression for up to thousands of genes at near-single-cell, 
    single-cell, or sub-cellular resolution, together with the spatial positions 
    of the measurements. Analyzing combined molecular and spatial information 
    has generated new insights about biological processes that manifest in a 
    spatial manner within tissues. However, to efficiently analyze these data, 
    specialized data infrastructure is required, which facilitates storage, 
    retrieval, subsetting, and interfacing with downstream tools. 
    SpatialExperiment is a new data infrastructure for storing and accessing 
    spatially resolved transcriptomics data, implemented within the Bioconductor 
    framework in R. SpatialExperiment extends the existing SingleCellExperiment 
    for single-cell data, which brings with it advantages of modularity, 
    interoperability, standardized operations, and comprehensive documentation. 
    SpatialExperiment is extendable to alternative technological platforms 
    measuring expression and to new types of data modalities, such as spatial 
    immunofluorescence or proteomics, in the future.
    In this workshop, we provide an overview of spot-based and molecule-based 
    spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies, an introduction to 
    SpatialExperiment, an explanation of the structure of the SpatialExperiment 
    class, and interactive examples showing how to load and visualize datasets 
    that have been formatted as SpatialExperiment objects.
